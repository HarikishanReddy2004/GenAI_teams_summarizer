I completed the bug fix in the backend logic for SCRUM-2, ensuring the system handles edge cases more reliably. While validating the changes, I took the opportunity to test the GitHub Copilot integration using two different repositories, both of which responded well to the suggestions and workflows. The integration worked smoothly and didnâ€™t show any major inconsistencies. During these tests, I noticed a small issue with the API response validation, which could have caused minor misinterpretations under certain conditions. I dug deeper into the validation logic and identified the root cause. After isolating the issue, I implemented a quick fix to stabilize the response behavior. Following this, I re-ran the test scenarios and confirmed that the fix worked as expected without side effects. The Copilot testing remained consistent post-fix, which was a good indicator of overall stability. I'm wrapping up this cycle of changes and documentation. I will be raising a PR today to merge all these improvements into the main branch.
